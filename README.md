# ChatBotWebAppAI
Developed a Java-based web chatbot application using JSP and Servlets to simulate real-time user interaction.

Implemented a rule-based Chatbot Engine in Java to process user inputs and generate predefined responses.

Used Servlets for handling HTTP requests and controlling application flow, and JSP for dynamic UI rendering.

Configured servlet mappings and deployment using web.xml.

Followed MVC-style architecture to maintain separation of presentation, business logic, and control layers.

Deployed and tested the application on Apache Tomcat Server.
